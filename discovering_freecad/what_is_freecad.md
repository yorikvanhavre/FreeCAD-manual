FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeling application, designed for use by everyone. [Parametric modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_feature_based_modeler), which FreeCAD uses heavily, is unique among modeling methods because 3D shapes are defined by parameters. For example, the shape of a brick might be controlled by three parameters: height, width and length. In FreeCAD, much like other parametric modelers, these parameters are part of the object being modeled, and always remain editable. Objects can have other objects as parameters, for example, you could have an object that takes a brick as an input, and creates a column from it, much like you would in real life. Parametric objects can be thought of as small programs that create geometries from parameters.

From giant buildings to small 3D-printable pieces, FreeCAD isn't limited to one type of design. Instead, it allows users to produce models of all sizes and purposes. Each of type of design has specialized toolsets and workflows built into FreeCAD.

FreeCAD is also multiplatform (it runs identically on Windows, Mac OS and Linux platforms.) FreeCAD is open source and was built by the perseverance and hard work of a large community of dedicated programmers, enthusiasts and users worldwide. FreeCAD is an application built by the people. Instead of being made by a company whose goal is to make the most money, FreeCAD was made by a community whose goal is to make the best 3D modeling program possible. FreeCAD is free, not only to use, but also to distribute, copy, modify, or sell.

FreeCAD is built upon the shoulders of giants, made possible because of the accumulated experience of the open-source world. FreeCAD can be used as a component in a variety of other applications. Possessing a multitude of features, from its widespread file format support and to its thoroughly scriptable nature, FreeCAD has become a beacon for open source standards. FreeCAD's past and future growth is made possible solely through a dynamic and enthusiastic community of users.
